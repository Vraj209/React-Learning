Redux is independent state management library -> every where is work
-> react -> react-redux

flux is previous statemangment , data flow

introduce redux
|
 
single source of truth,state should be read only

"you should never modify your state"
or
"you should never mutate your state"

changes should be done via function -> Reducer
workflow should be smooth


redux - it is good but it come up with difrent problem
|
redux-toolkit -> built in middlewares


store -> only one store, single source of truth means global variables
reducers -> change should be written in function
useSelector -> to access the data from the store
useDispatch -> to run the functionalities of the store

1) Store:
- src / app / store.js
- import {configureStore} from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
- Create a store -> export const store = configureStore({})

2) Reducer: All Functionalities
    - src / features / todo / todoSlice.js
        - import {createSlice} from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
        - create initial state
    - create todoSlice
        - addd name property
        - add initialState property
        - add reducers -> properties and functions
            - function should be defined not declared in reducers
            - in reducers we have state and action
            - state used for to get idea about the current state
            - action used for to get value
    - export all methods of reducers
        - export const { addTodo, removeTodo } = todoSlice.actions;
        - export reducer

3) Now I can use this reducer in store.js
    - import todoReducer from '../features/todo/todoSlice'
    - add reducer in store
        -> export const store = configureStore({ reducer: todoReducer})
    
    - useDispatch ->  to run Functionalities of store
        - with the use of reducers , useDispatch send the data to the store
        - useDispatch -> reducers -> store

    - useSelector -> access data from the store
        - const todos = useSelector(state => state.todos)


4) Add Wrapper in main.jsx and pass store in Provider
    - import {Provider} from 'react-redux'
    - import {store} from './app/store'
    - <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
      </Provider>
